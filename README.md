Quadris
=======

A latinization of tetris. Developed by Michael Hewson and Justin Leclerc for a CS assignment at the University of Waterloo.

The game was developed on Mac OS X, but should work on most Unix-based systems. To try it out, clone this repository, run 'make' from within the repository, and type './quadris' to run the program.
